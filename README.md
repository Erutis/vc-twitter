# Objective

The objective of this project is to create an NLP text generator that generates text based off of the most prominent venture capitalist Twitter accounts. The final format will either be a website with a button that generates text or even a Twitter bot that posts generated tweets. The purpose of this is to simulate founder advice and inspiration from what VCs say on their accounts. 

Success metrics will be focused on interpretability of output and humor.



## Data Collection

This project will use Twitter's API to scrape the latest tweets from select accounts which will be kept anonymous. 


## Modeling

I am considering training my own models from scratch or making use of an accessible version of GPT. If I choose the latter, I will use something available on Hugging Face (possibly [this one](https://huggingface.co/gpt2)). # vc-twitter
